#### some notes...

- `cp .vscode/settings.example.json .vscode/settings.json` // apply and extend
  vscode settings for this project
- `tsconfig.json` // not really required, because deno is do all job... but
  because of **vue** files, for better development experience it configure
  typescript (again: typescript is not actually do something real here except
  highliting and hinting to developer)
  - monitor better solutions for this point
